Leaflet Examples
======================

##Index.html
This  example covers the basics

* Geometry: Points, Lines, Polygons
* GeoJSON
* Events

##GeoJSON.html
This example shows hos to load and style GeoJSON. I have included two files: The geojson and a js file that makes it a variable for including. I cannot make the AJAX call to GitHub, so for the sake of presenting the example, I load it as .JS.
